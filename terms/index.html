      <h2><small>Overview</small></h2>
      <p>
        We expect that you'll treat other people with respect while using
        GoodChat. We hope it brings you good conversations and new friendships!
      </p>
      <p>
        In return, we'll do our very best to make your experience of GoodChat
        safe and enjoyable. We'll work hard to keep your data secure, and we
        won't sell/trade/give/whatever it to anyone else.
      </p>
      <h2><small>Details</small></h2>
      <p>
        1. You must be respectful to other users on Goodchat. If someone is not
        being respectful to you, don't sink to their level, just block them,
        and if you fell it's warranted, report their behaviour to us. If need
        be, we'll sort them out.
      <p>
      </p>
        Some examples of behaviour which is not respectful are:
      <p>
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>making repeated unwelcome contact with someone</li>
          <li>
            creating an account which pretends to be someone who you are not
          </li>
          <li>publicising another person's personal details</li>
          <li>threatening another person</li>
          <li>embarrassing another person</li>
        </ol>
        You get the drift!
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The code of conduct of the conference you're attending also applies
        within GoodChat. If you breach the conference's code of conduct in your
        use of GoodChat, we may report that to the conference organisers and
        show them the relevant activity from your GoodChat account.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. You do not need to give GoodChat any information about your legal
        identity. Feel free to create your account with a pseudonym.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. We will use the information you provide to GoodChat only for the
        purpose of providing you with the GoodChat service. We take data
        privacy seriously, and our privacy policy is part of these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. GoodChat is pseudo-ephemeral. Will will delete the GoodChat database
        and logs associated with the conference you are attending one week
        after the conference ends, so don't store important data in GoodChat!
      </p>
      <p>
        6. You must be 16 years of age or older to use GoodChat.
      </p>

        8. Don't rely on GoodChat to do or not do any particular thing. We are
        not liable for any loss or damage caused by your use of GoodChat.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. If we decide that any GoodChat user has breached these terms of
        service, we will take action, and that may include restricting or
        removing their account. We take the well-being of <strong>all</strong>
        GoodChat's users very seriously, and we will act quickly and decisively
        to stop people treating each other badly on our platform.
