      <h2><small>Overview</small></h2>
      <p>
        Privacy and anti-surveillance are issues close to our hearts. We only
        collect as much information as we need to provide the GoodChat service,
        and we only retain that information for one week after the conference
        you're attending ends before deleting it forever.
      </p>
      <h2><small>Details</small></h2>
      <p>
        1. GoodChat collects this information about you:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The information you add to your profile, such as your username,
            interests and email address.
          </li>
          <li>
            The messages you send to others, including the contents of each
            message and when it was sent.
          </li>
          <li>
            The accounts of other people which you star and block.
          </li>
          <li>
            The connections your web browser makes with our server, including
            your IP address, browser type and each page requested.
          </li>
        </ol>
        When you give us this information, you consent to us using it to
        provide you with the GoodChat service.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. We use information described at 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 to provide you with
        the GoodChat service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use information described at 1.4 to keep GoodChat secure, and to
        respond to the load on our server so that we can maintain the
        availability of the Goodchat service.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. We will use the information you provide to GoodChat only for the
        purpose of providing the GoodChat service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information described at 1.1 will be visible to all other GoodChat
        users, unless you have blocked them. Your email address is never
        visible to other GoodChat users -- it's optional, and only used so that
        you can reset a forgotten password.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information described at 1.2 will be visible to the other user who
        you have sent the message to.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of providing the GoodChat service, we may share information
        relevant to a breach of the code of conduct of the conference you're
        attending with the organisers of the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take data privacy very seriously, and will not give, share, trade or
        sell your data to anyone else in any other circumstances unless we are
        required to by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. GoodChat uses cookies to keep you logged in to your GoodChat
        account. That is all that GoodChat's cookies do; they will not track
        you on other websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. We store your data on our server in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We
        rent this server from Digital Ocean. Depending on your location, your
        data will cross national borders when being transferred to and from our
        server.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. We will keep your data on our server until one week after the
        conference you attended finishes, when we will delete all of it,
        forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only time we may keep any of your data for longer than this, is if
        we need to keep it for longer to deal with a legal matter, or breach of
        the terms of service. In these cases we will delete it as soon as is
        practical.
      </p>
